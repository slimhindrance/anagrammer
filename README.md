# Anagrammer

I find anagrams fun, and my username here is an anagram of my own name.

I've known for a while that I needed to learn how to vectorize my code for speed.  I recently ran into an assignment that required it to a degree that I dropped a class, realizing I really need to learn to work in vectors.

So, I'm going to vectorize a name, and a massive list of English words, and with any luck, I'll be able to create something cool.
